# Notification System Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

A comprehensive automated notification system for booking creation and payment deadline reminders has been successfully implemented.

## Key Features

### 1. Booking Creation Alerts
- ✅ Immediate notifications to Managers and Owners when bookings are created
- ✅ Includes event details and creator information

### 2. Payment Deadline Reminders
- ✅ Automated reminders at: 7 days, 3 days, 1 day before event
- ✅ Overdue notice on event day if payment still pending
- ✅ Only sent if payment deadline hasn't passed yet

### 3. Payment Completion Notifications
- ✅ Notifications when full payment is received
- ✅ Automatic cancellation of pending payment reminders

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
- **New Model**: `ScheduledNotification` to track scheduled notifications
- **Migration**: `20251026185919_add_scheduled_notifications` applied successfully
- **Indexes**: Added for efficient querying by booking and schedule time

### New Files Created

1. **lib/notification-scheduler.ts**
   - Core scheduling and sending logic
   - Functions: schedule, send, cancel, process notifications

2. **app/api/cron/notifications/route.ts**
   - Cron job endpoint
   - Protected by CRON_SECRET authentication

3. **vercel.json**
   - Cron job configuration
   - Runs daily at 8:00 AM UTC

4. **NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md**
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Setup instructions, troubleshooting, API reference

### Modified Files

1. **prisma/schema.prisma**
   - Added ScheduledNotification model
   - Added relation to Booking model

2. **server/Booking/pushActions.ts**
   - Integrated notification scheduling on booking creation
   - Sends immediate booking creation notifications

3. **server/Billing & Payments/pushActions.ts**
   - Integrated payment completion notifications
   - Cancels pending reminders when fully paid

4. **.env**
   - Added CRON_SECRET configuration

## Notification Types

| Type | Trigger | Recipients | Timing |
|------|---------|------------|--------|
| BOOKING_CREATED | New booking | Managers & Owners | Immediate |
| PAYMENT_REMINDER_7 | Event in 7 days | Managers & Owners | 8 AM, 7 days before |
| PAYMENT_REMINDER_3 | Event in 3 days | Managers & Owners | 8 AM, 3 days before |
| PAYMENT_REMINDER_1 | Event in 1 day | Managers & Owners | 8 AM, 1 day before |
| PAYMENT_OVERDUE | Event day, unpaid | Owners only | 8 AM, event day |
| PAYMENT_COMPLETED | Payment received | Managers & Owners | Immediate |

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Environment Variable (Required)
Add to your production environment:
```bash
CRON_SECRET="your-secure-random-secret-here"
```

**Generate a secure secret:**
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### 2. Vercel Configuration (For Production)
The `vercel.json` file is already configured to run the cron job daily at 8:00 AM UTC.

When deploying to Vercel:
1. Add `CRON_SECRET` to your environment variables
2. Deploy your application
3. The cron job will automatically run daily

## How It Works

### Booking Creation Flow
```
1. User creates booking
   ↓
2. scheduleBookingNotifications(bookingId)
   - Creates scheduled notifications for 7d, 3d, 1d before event
   - Only for dates in the future
   ↓
3. sendBookingCreatedNotifications(bookingId)
   - Sends immediate notification to Managers & Owners
```

### Payment Completion Flow
```
1. Payment is recorded
   ↓
2. Check if fully paid
   ↓
3. If yes:
   - sendPaymentCompletedNotifications(bookingId, amount)
   - cancelPaymentReminders(bookingId)
```

### Daily Cron Job Flow
```
1. Cron job runs at 8:00 AM UTC
   ↓
2. processPendingNotifications()
   - Finds all scheduled notifications due now
   - Sends notifications to appropriate users
   - Marks as sent
```

## Testing

### Test Locally
```bash
# 1. Make sure CRON_SECRET is in .env
# 2. Start your dev server
# 3. Call the cron endpoint

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secure-random-secret-here" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/cron/notifications
```

### Test Booking Creation
1. Create a new booking through the UI
2. Check the Notifications table for new notifications
3. Verify Managers and Owners received the notification

### Test Payment Completion
1. Add a payment that completes the booking
2. Check that payment completion notification was sent
3. Verify pending reminders were cancelled

## Monitoring

### Check Pending Notifications
```sql
SELECT * FROM ScheduledNotification
WHERE sent = false
ORDER BY scheduledFor;
```

### Check Sent Notifications
```sql
SELECT * FROM ScheduledNotification
WHERE sent = true
ORDER BY sentAt DESC;
```

### Check Recent User Notifications
```sql
SELECT * FROM Notification
WHERE type IN ('BOOKING', 'PAYMENT')
ORDER BY createdAt DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Important Notes

1. **Payment Deadline**: The event start date (`booking.startAt`) is considered the payment deadline

2. **Notification Timing**: All scheduled notifications are sent at 8:00 AM local time

3. **Error Handling**: Notification errors are logged but don't prevent booking/payment creation

4. **Future Dates Only**: Only schedules notifications for dates that haven't passed yet

5. **Auto-Cancellation**: Payment reminders are automatically cancelled when full payment is received

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Email Integration**: Send email notifications to clients
2. **SMS Reminders**: Add SMS capability for critical deadlines
3. **Customizable Timing**: Allow admins to configure reminder schedules
4. **Notification Preferences**: Let users choose which notifications they receive
5. **Client Notifications**: Extend system to notify clients directly

## Troubleshooting

See `NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps.

Common issues:
- Notifications not sending → Check CRON_SECRET and cron job logs
- Duplicate notifications → Check for duplicate scheduled records
- Reminders after payment → Verify cancelPaymentReminders is being called
