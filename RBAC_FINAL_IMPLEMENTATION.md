## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Requesting a Discount

**As Manager or Front Desk:**
```tsx
import { RequestDiscountModal } from '@/components/discounts/RequestDiscountModal';

<RequestDiscountModal
  open={showModal}
  onOpenChange={setShowModal}
  bookingId={booking.id}
  originalAmount={booking.totalAmount}
  onSuccess={() => {
    // Refresh data
    router.refresh();
  }}
/>
```

### 2. Checking Permissions

**In Components:**
```tsx
import { RoleGuard, PermissionButton } from '@/components/auth';

// Conditional rendering
<RoleGuard permission="discounts:approve">
  <Button>Approve Discount</Button>
</RoleGuard>

// Smart button with auto-disable
<PermissionButton
  permission="employees:delete"
  onClick={handleDelete}
  variant="destructive"
>
  Delete Employee
</PermissionButton>
```

**In API Routes:**
```tsx
import { hasPermission } from '@/lib/permissions';

if (!hasPermission(session.user.role, 'employees:create')) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Insufficient permissions' },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

### 3. Logging Activity

```tsx
import { logActivity } from '@/lib/activity-log';

await logActivity(
  userId,
  'employee_created',
  'employee',
  {
    employeeId: newEmployee.id,
    name: newEmployee.name,
    role: newEmployee.role
  },
  req.headers.get('x-forwarded-for'),
  req.headers.get('user-agent')
);
```

### 4. Sending Notifications

```tsx
import {
  notifyDiscountApproved,
  notifyNewDiscountRequest
} from '@/lib/notifications';

// Notify requester
await notifyDiscountApproved(
  requesterId,
  discountRequest,
  approverName
);

// Notify all owners
const owners = await prisma.employee.findMany({
  where: { role: 'OWNER' }
});
await notifyNewDiscountRequest(
  owners.map(o => o.id),
  discountRequest,
  requesterName
);
```

### 5. Adding Notification Bell to Header

```tsx
import { NotificationBell } from '@/components/notifications';

export function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      {/* Your header content */}
      <NotificationBell />
    </header>
  );
}
```
