# Notification System - Simplified Implementation

## ✨ What Changed

The notification system has been **simplified and enhanced** based on your feedback! Here's what's new:

### 🎯 Key Improvements

#### 1. **Unified Notification Table**
The `Notification` model now includes all the necessary information in one place:

```prisma
model Notification {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId    String
  type      String   // "BOOKING", "PAYMENT", etc.
  title     String
  message   String
  link      String?
  read      Boolean  @default(false)

  // NEW: Direct booking and client references
  bookingId Int?
  booking   Booking?
  clientId  Int?
  client    Client?

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ All notification data in one table
- ✅ Direct access to booking and client information
- ✅ Easy filtering by read/unread status
- ✅ Quick access to related booking details

#### 2. **Smart Notification Links**
Every notification includes:
- `bookingId` - Links directly to the booking
- `clientId` - Access to client information
- `link` - Pre-built URL to open the booking (e.g., `/manage/bookings/123`)

**When you click a notification**:
1. It marks as read
2. Opens the booking details page
3. Shows all relevant booking, billing, and payment info

#### 3. **Simple Status Tracking**
- `read: false` = Unread notification (shows in dropdown with badge)
- `read: true` = Read notification (no badge, archived)

No complex state management - just a simple boolean!

### 📊 How It Works

#### Creating a Booking:
```
1. User creates booking
   ↓
2. System creates notifications for Managers/Owners
   {
     type: "BOOKING",
     title: "New Booking Created",
     message: "New booking: Birthday Party on March 15...",
     link: "/manage/bookings/123",
     bookingId: 123,
     clientId: 45,
     read: false
   }
   ↓
3. Notifications appear in bell dropdown
```

#### Processing Scheduled Reminders:
```
1. Daily cron job runs (or manual script)
   ↓
2. Finds scheduled notifications due today
   ↓
3. Creates notification records
   {
     type: "PAYMENT",
     title: "Urgent: Payment Pending",
     message: "Payment pending for Jane Smith...",
     bookingId: 123,
     clientId: 45,
     read: false
   }
   ↓
4. Users see reminders in notification bell
```

#### Clicking a Notification:
```
1. User clicks notification in dropdown
   ↓
2. Notification marked as read: { read: true }
   ↓
3. Opens booking page: /manage/bookings/123
   ↓
4. User sees full booking details, billing, payments
```

### 🔔 Notification Dropdown Features

The notification dropdown now:
- ✅ Shows only **unread** notifications by default
- ✅ Has a **"Show All"** filter to see read notifications
- ✅ Displays badge count (number of unread)
- ✅ Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- ✅ Marks as read on click
- ✅ "Mark all as read" button
- ✅ Links directly to booking details

### 📝 Database Schema

```sql
-- Simple query to see unread notifications
SELECT * FROM Notification
WHERE userId = 'user-id' AND read = false
ORDER BY createdAt DESC;

-- Get all notifications for a booking
SELECT * FROM Notification
WHERE bookingId = 123
ORDER BY createdAt DESC;

-- Get all notifications for a client
SELECT * FROM Notification
WHERE clientId = 45
ORDER BY createdAt DESC;

-- Mark notification as read
UPDATE Notification
SET read = true
WHERE id = 'notification-id';
```

### 🎨 What You'll See

#### Notification Bell Badge:
```
🔔 (3)  ← 3 unread notifications
```

#### Dropdown (Unread Only):
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐

│ Yesterday                            │ ← Read (no dot)
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🚀 Benefits

#### For You (Developer):
1. **Simpler Code**: One table, straightforward queries
2. **Easy Filtering**: Just check `read` boolean
3. **Better Relations**: Direct access to booking and client
4. **Flexible**: Easy to add more notification types

#### For Users:

2. **Quick Access**: Click to open booking directly
3. **Complete Info**: All booking/client data in one click
4. **Filter Options**: Switch between unread and all

### 📦 Files Updated

2. ✅ `lib/notification-scheduler.ts` - Updated to include booking/client IDs
3. ✅ Migration created: `20251026192448_simplify_notifications`

### 🧪 Testing

#### Check Notifications in Database:
```sql
-- See all unread notifications
SELECT n.*,
       b.eventName,
       c.firstName || ' ' || c.lastName as clientName
FROM Notification n
LEFT JOIN Booking b ON n.bookingId = b.id
LEFT JOIN Client c ON n.clientId = c.id
WHERE n.read = false
ORDER BY n.createdAt DESC;
```

#### Test the Flow:
1. Create a booking
2. Check notification bell - should show badge (1)
3. Click bell - see notification
4. Click notification - marks as read, opens booking
5. Check bell again - badge should decrease
