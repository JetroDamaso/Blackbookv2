This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run these command by order:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
# setup prisma
npx prisma migrate dev
#run the dev build
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

```
✅ What they get

All your source code (app/, components/, server/, etc.)

Prisma schema & migrations so they can recreate the DB.

Public images (since you kept those in the repo).

❌ What they don’t get

node_modules/ (they install themselves).

Your local dev.db (they generate their own via migrations).

Any sensitive .env secrets (they set up their own).


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
