## üö® Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Sidebar Shows on Login Page

**Possible Causes:**
- Session not properly initialized
- Missing user data in session
- NextAuth configuration issues

### Issue: Logout Not Working
**Debug Steps:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify NextAuth signOut function
3. Confirm redirect logic in handleLogout

### Issue: Layout Shifts During Login
**Solution:** Ensure proper loading states in ConditionalLayout

## üîç Browser Console Checks

### During Login
```
// Should see session creation

// Should show user object with: id, name, email, role, employeeId
```

### During Logout
```

console.log("Logout initiated");
// Should show navigation to /login
```
