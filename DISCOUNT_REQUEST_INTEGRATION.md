# Discount Request Integration - Add Bookings Page

## Overview
Successfully integrated the discount request functionality into the Add Bookings page, allowing Manager and Front Desk roles to request discounts from the Owner for bookings.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Component Import**
Added import for `RequestDiscountModal` component:
```typescript
import { RequestDiscountModal } from "@/components/discounts/RequestDiscountModal";
```

### 2. **State Management**
Added new state to manage the discount request modal:
```typescript
const [isDiscountRequestModalOpen, setIsDiscountRequestModalOpen] = useState(false);
```

### 3. **UI Enhancement - Discount Section**
Updated the discount section header to include a "Request Discount" button:
- **Location**: Discount Block (line ~3550)
- **Functionality**:
  - Shows a "Request Discount" button in the header
  - Validates that booking is created before allowing discount request
  - Shows error toast if user tries to request discount before creating booking

```tsx
<div className="flex justify-between items-center mb-2">
  <p className="font-bold text-lg">Discount</p>
  <Button
    type="button"
    variant="outline"
    size="sm"
    onClick={() => {
      if (!createdBookingId) {
        toast.error("Please save the booking first before requesting a discount");
        return;
      }
      setIsDiscountRequestModalOpen(true);
    }}
  >
    <Plus className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
    Request Discount
  </Button>
</div>
```

### 4. **Modal Integration**
Added the `RequestDiscountModal` component at the end of the form:
```tsx
{createdBookingId && (
  <RequestDiscountModal
    open={isDiscountRequestModalOpen}
    onOpenChange={setIsDiscountRequestModalOpen}
    bookingId={createdBookingId}
    originalAmount={originalPrice}
    onSuccess={() => {
      toast.success("Discount request submitted successfully!");
    }}
  />
)}
```

## User Flow

### Before Booking Creation:
1. User fills out booking form
2. If they click "Request Discount" → Error message: "Please save the booking first"

### After Booking Creation:
1. User creates a booking successfully
2. Booking ID is stored in `createdBookingId` state
3. User clicks "Request Discount" button
4. Modal opens with:
   - Discount type selector (Percentage/Fixed Amount)
   - Discount value input
   - Justification textarea (required)
   - Real-time calculation showing original amount, discount, and final amount
5. User submits request
6. Request is sent to Owner for approval
7. Success toast appears
8. Modal closes

## Benefits

### 1. **Role-Based Discount Management**
- Managers and Front Desk can request discounts but cannot directly apply them
- Owner must approve all discount requests
- Creates an audit trail for all discount applications

### 2. **Better User Experience**
- Clear validation messages
- Real-time price calculations
- Visual feedback with success/error toasts
- Integrated workflow within booking creation process

### 3. **Security & Compliance**
- Prevents unauthorized discounts
- Requires justification for every discount request
- All requests tracked in discount_requests table
- Owner notification system triggers automatically

## Technical Details

### Props Passed to RequestDiscountModal:
- `open`: Boolean controlling modal visibility
- `onOpenChange`: Function to handle modal open/close state
- `bookingId`: The ID of the created booking (required)
- `originalAmount`: The total booking amount before discount

### Validation:

### API Endpoint Used:
